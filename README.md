# Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

•The goal of this project is to cluster the Iris dataset into its respective species using the K-Means Clustering algorithm.

•From the ‘Iris’ dataset, predicted the optimum number of clusters using elbow method and represented it visually.
